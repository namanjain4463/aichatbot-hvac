## üí° QUICK TIPS

1. **Use `LIMIT`** to avoid overwhelming results
2. **Check indexes first** - they're critical for performance
3. **Validate embeddings** - all chunks should have 1536-dim vectors
4. **Test relationships** - verify confidence thresholds
5. **Look for patterns** - complex queries show system intelligence
6. **Monitor performance** - slow queries indicate indexing issues

---

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING QUERIES

### No Graph Results?

```cypher
// Check if entities exist
MATCH (e) WHERE e:Component OR e:Code OR e:Problem
RETURN labels(e)[0] as type, count(*) as count;

// If zero, entity extraction may have failed
```

### No Vector Results?

```cypher
// Check embeddings
MATCH (c:Chunk) WHERE c.embedding IS NULL
RETURN count(c);

// Check index
SHOW INDEXES WHERE type = "VECTOR";

// If index missing or embeddings null, vector search won't work
```

### Slow Queries?

```cypher
// Check database size
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);
MATCH ()-[r]->() RETURN count(r);

// Large graphs (>10K nodes) may need additional indexes
```

---

## üìã VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Run these in order for complete validation:

```cypher
// 1. Node count
MATCH (n) RETURN count(n);

// 2. Relationship count
MATCH ()-[r]->() RETURN count(r);

// 3. Index check
SHOW INDEXES;

// 4. Embedding check
MATCH (c:Chunk) WHERE c.embedding IS NULL RETURN count(c);

// 5. Confidence check
MATCH ()-[r:MENTIONS]->() RETURN avg(r.confidence), min(r.confidence);

// 6. Sample entities
MATCH (e) WHERE e.confidence > 0.8 RETURN labels(e)[0], e.text LIMIT 10;
```

If all 6 pass ‚Üí Graph is healthy ‚úÖ
